# XP Values Journal

This document has been created to maintain a weekly journal entry to ensure that the Agile XP values are preserved during the implementation of this project.

## Week 1:

**1. Simplicty**

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

The best way to eliminate waste is to do what is being asked and not more than that. Right from the starting our priority was to discard unwanted features and processes.

During the first week, we used the knowledge that was available within the team members and tried not to reinvent the wheel. We shared knowledge throughout the week in our meetings and Meeting Minutes were documented.

We discussed to use open-source templates as the aim of this project is to implement Backend Data Service thus eliminating and focusing on what is being asked.

In the end of the meeting, we asked each member to think on what should be the suite of our application, what will be the process flow, and what complexities can arrive in the sub modules and share their understanding in next meeting.

The first week constituted one of the most important tasks of the project. Decisions on the domain and individual sub-domain responsibilities were made. Research was carried out with respect to the domain, sub-domains and possible architectures. During the two team meetings that were held during the week, the team focused on analysing different workflows for their respective sub-domains. We then worked together to narrow them down to ensure that the modules when integrated would add value to the project as a whole.

The decision to use the MERN stack was made. This was done to ensure consistency in the different modules, keeping in mind that the project in the end would be delivered by the team. The focus has been on what "we" must achieve as opposed to what "I" must achieve, which would ensure that wholistic goals are always considered while building any component in the product.

The team has been supportive and seem to have no issues sharing their thoughts and collaborating on ideas. There is a great deal of enthusiasm and passion towards what we wish to achieve. We seem to be on the right track and will continue to collaborate to achieve our goals within the target time frame.

## Week 2:

**2. Eliminate Waste**

This week, we finalized the Graphical User Interface and the architecture. We searched for open source User Interfaces so that our focus stays on the back end part. The meeting took place in the MLK Library meeting room where we collectively searched for open source user interface suitable for the project. After finalizing the user interface we discussed about various architectures. Each team member had their own pros and cons for the architectures and in the end we settled for one. We also made flow diagrams on the white board to to get a better understanding of the processes. We also finalized the templates for Unit testing and how we will approach it.

After that we discussed the TO-Do's for the next meeting in which each member had to create the User interface for their respective sub-module and how we will be integrating all these sub modules together.

Instead of researching individually we researched as a team for the User interface templates on the big screen thus eliminating wastage of time and energy. Our team's weekly agenda is clear, eliminating unnecessary confusion and doubts among the team members.

This week, the focus was to have a concrete architecture for the product. The team got together and discussed the various options available for implementation and each member shared their thoughts on the pros and cons of using the respective architectures. At times we found one model to be perfect a specific component, but were able to drill down to see its impact on the other components. This allowed us to eliminate a variety of options and come up with an architecture suitable considering the project as a whole.

The team continues to focus on a wholistic approach by refining the ideas behind each module to meet the requirements and goals of the project. There is a clear understanding on individual responsibilities and the impact their decisions have on the project. The mid-week meeting assists the team to ensure that all aspects are taken into consideration while making component and architecture based decisions to reduce complexities during the implementation phase.
