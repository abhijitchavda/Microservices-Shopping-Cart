# XP Values Journal

This document has been created to maintain a weekly journal entry to ensure that the Agile XP values are preserved during the implementation of this project.

## Week 1:

**1. Simplicty - Niral Koradia**

“Simplicity is the real beauty”

From the starting of the project, all of our team members have decided to go with the simple approaches throughout the project implementation. We believe that for all complex problem, solution is always simple.

In the first week, we discussed about the understanding about the project requirement and things that we need to research about the technologies. Our goal is to make best application for the given project requirement keeping in mind time frames and approaches. We, as a team, agreed to come up on next meeting with project architecture along with technology stacks.

After the professor’s confirmation on usage of simple or open source templates for front-end development, it’s pretty clear for us to focus more on Back-end service and it’s deployment on cloud cluster.

As a meeting conclusion, we asked each team member to research on different tools, application functionality scope and code-development approaches and share their opinion in next meeting before finalizing the project structure and flow of the application.



**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

The best way to eliminate waste is to do what is being asked and not more than that. Right from the starting our priority was to discard unwanted features and processes.

During the first week, we used the knowledge that was available within the team members and tried not to reinvent the wheel. We shared knowledge throughout the week in our meetings and Meeting Minutes were documented.

We discussed to use open-source templates as the aim of this project is to implement Backend Data Service thus eliminating and focusing on what is being asked.

In the end of the meeting, we asked each member to think on what should be the suite of our application, what will be the process flow, and what complexities can arrive in the sub modules and share their understanding in next meeting.

**3. See the whole**

The first week constituted one of the most important tasks of the project. Decisions on the domain and individual sub-domain responsibilities were made. Research was carried out with respect to the domain, sub-domains and possible architectures. During the two team meetings that were held during the week, the team focused on analysing different workflows for their respective sub-domains. We then worked together to narrow them down to ensure that the modules when integrated would add value to the project as a whole.

The decision to use the MERN stack was made. This was done to ensure consistency in the different modules, keeping in mind that the project in the end would be delivered by the team. The focus has been on what "we" must achieve as opposed to what "I" must achieve, which would ensure that wholistic goals are always considered while building any component in the product.

The team has been supportive and seem to have no issues sharing their thoughts and collaborating on ideas. There is a great deal of enthusiasm and passion towards what we wish to achieve. We seem to be on the right track and will continue to collaborate to achieve our goals within the target time frame.

**4. Communication**

The value 'communication' is one of the important aspect of an agile project. Communication in our project is classified into two areas viz.,
<li>Team communication</li>: Team members working together need to communicate in a manner which is most effective and result driven. The team meets twice a week in order to discuss the ideas, current progress and issues related to the project. These meetings are driven by an agenda with all the minutes recorded and published on a weekly basis. We have also created a channel on **slack** as an official outlet for team communication.
<li>Review communication</li>: Reviewing the work that is complete at regular intevals is an integral part of any project. For our project we will be having regular review sessions with project manager (Prof. Paul) so that our work aligns with all the guidelines and processess defined.


As on the first week, the team is actively and equally involved in the team meetings as well as on the slack channel. The minutes of the meetings have also been updated in the project repository.

**5. Feedback-Abhijitsinh**

From the very first day itself, we as a team decided upon taking feedback from each team member before taking any major steps for the project. We as a team understand that early and frequent feedback will help us see things with different perspective. This will give us plethora of option from which we can choose the best one for the project.

Feedback from team members

-As a team we decided that each team member would come up with ideas on project domain and sub domains to choose for the project. Each team member presented ideas for the same. Each idea was followed by feedback from team members with pros and cons about the idea.

-As a team we decided that each team member would come up with the basic idea about their respective sub-domains functionality and architecture. Each team member presented functionalities of their respective sub-domain. The presentation was followed by feedback from all the team members. We discussed what obstacles we would face and what could be the possible solution to overcome those obstacles.
  
Feedback from professor

-As a team we decided to simplify our project by using open source templates for front end requirement. This idea was discussed with professor and based on professors feedback we decided to go with available open source templates for front end.

## Week 2:

**1. Simplicty -- Niral Koradia**

In the second week of our project, we decided to finalize the basic architecture of the system. Each team member comes up with their understanding about the type of functionalities that their respective sub-domains. We discussed the approaches to achieve those functionalities and basic workflow of subdomain module.

Initially, we are confused with so many functionalities and how to incorporate it into our project. To make it simple, we have noted down the functionalities sub-domain wise on the White Board and decide to go with the basic working functionalities first and make it workable. Our motto is to be simple in each stage with core functionalities.

To make the process simple, Each member has finalized the functionalities that need to build in the first go. Each team member will start with their frontend part first. After the completion of front-end, we will start will back-end. To make the back-end simple and scalable, we will be creating micro-service for each functionality.

As a meeting conclusion, we asked each team member to start working on their 
individual domain with the simple approach of the building project by creating micro-services for each functionality.

**2. Eliminate Waste**

This week, we finalized the Graphical User Interface and the architecture. We searched for open source User Interfaces so that our focus stays on the back end part. The meeting took place in the MLK Library meeting room where we collectively searched for open source user interface suitable for the project. After finalizing the user interface we discussed about various architectures. Each team member had their own pros and cons for the architectures and in the end we settled for one. We also made flow diagrams on the white board to to get a better understanding of the processes. We also finalized the templates for Unit testing and how we will approach it.

After that we discussed the TO-Do's for the next meeting in which each member had to create the User interface for their respective sub-module and how we will be integrating all these sub modules together.

Instead of researching individually we researched as a team for the User interface templates on the big screen thus eliminating wastage of time and energy. Our team's weekly agenda is clear, eliminating unnecessary confusion and doubts among the team members.

**3. See the whole**

This week, the focus was to have a concrete architecture for the product. The team got together and discussed the various options available for implementation and each member shared their thoughts on the pros and cons of using the respective architectures. At times we found one model to be perfect a specific component, but were able to drill down to see its impact on the other components. This allowed us to eliminate a variety of options and come up with an architecture suitable considering the project as a whole.

The team continues to focus on a wholistic approach by refining the ideas behind each module to meet the requirements and goals of the project. There is a clear understanding on individual responsibilities and the impact their decisions have on the project. The mid-week meeting assists the team to ensure that all aspects are taken into consideration while making component and architecture based decisions to reduce complexities during the implementation phase.


**4. Communication**

This week the focus of our meeting was to go through the various options for our application. In order to facilitate this kind of a discussion it was necessary that all members met together and express their ideas using visual communication aids. A meeting room was booked in the MLK Library and the team was engaged in a productive discussion.

It was good to see each of the members actively contributing to their own sub modules as well as sharing inputs to others. We made full use of the projector and whiteboards that we had in order to have a collaborative and effective team meeting. There were times where the group diverted to sub topics but were quick enough to come back to the proposed agenda.

The project artifacts were shared on our **slack** channel and the minutes of the meeting were updated on to our wiki pages. It was decided that we have these meetings at least once in two weeks where we can discuss our ideas/progress in a meeting room.


**5. Feedback-Abhijitsinh**

This week we as a team decided to come up with basic architecture of the system. Each team member was asked to come with the type of functionalities that their respective sub-domains will have, different ways to achieve those functionalities and basic workflow of sub domain module.

Feedback from Team Members

Each team member came up with functionalities of their sub-domain. Each team member presented the functionalities to the team. This presentation was followed by feedback from the team. Feedback consisted of how some functionalities would complicate the overall system or would conflict with working of other sub-domain modules. Based on the feedback we redefined functionalities for each sub-domain.

As we all have selected particular sub-domain, at end we will be combining these modules to form complete system. We as a team took the functionalities of each sub-domain into consideration and created a basic workflow of our system. This would not have been possible without the feedback of each member on how each sub-domain would be functioning and interacting with others services.

As every project has its own problems and challenges, so does ours. We as a team discussed on different workflows for the project and what challenges will be faced if we follow a particular workflow. All team members gave their feedback on each workflow and finally came up with a workflow by using which we can avoid as many problems as possible. This would not have been possible without the inputs and feedback of each team member.

## Week 3:

**1. Simplicty -- Niral Koradia**

In our 3rd week, we worked on analysing design of the front end components and it's flow. In our analysis, we discussed various designs and it's complexities. Since our objective is to build the functionality working of the project rather than building it's look and feel, we have finalized the simple UI wireframes to kick start our project. One of our team member has prepared UI wireframes and our team has started building there individual UI modules. Once we build our simple working skeleton of the project we will work on enhancing it's look and feel.



**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week, the team analyed the UI wireframes to understand how our user interface will look like which give us a better idea when we will design the user interface. We tried to identify the complexities which would arise when we start with the coding and tried to analyze how we were going to challenge them so that project could runs smoothly. Thus  eliminatng waste by saving time which had been our moto from start.

**3. See the whole -- Aashish **

This week, the team got together to analyze the use cases and agree on the layout and design to get a better picture of the workflow. We identified implementation complexities and decided on options that would assist in simplifying tasks throughout all modules, stressing on reuse and clean code. We discussed the inter-dependencies that may exist and how to tackle them to ensure that the project in its entirety is simplified. The team continues to be enthusiastic and motivated to complete the project. 


**4. Communication**

The focus for this week was to complete the front end aspects of the application for all the modules. The meeting was setup to this effect and the front end aspects. During the meeting we discussed about the GUI for the login screen as well as the concurrent shopping cart screen.

The discussion continued with the wireframe model for each page, the model was updated wherever necessary and front-ends from real world applications were shared and discussed upon. It was decided to use some ideas from these into our application.

The minutes of the meeting along with the reference documentation were shared on our **slack channel** The timelines for certain aspects of the project were discussed and in some cases reviewed. All in all, in this meeting we were able to close our GUI screens for the modules of our application.


**5. Feedback -- Abhijitsinh**

We as a team decided to come up with the design of the front end components for each of the sub domains and a basic flow for all the sub-domains for this week. 

Feedback from the team

We as a team discussed the front end components of each sub domain and discussed the look and feel of each one. Each team member presented his idea on the front end design and how is he planning his user interaction for the same. Each presentation was followed by feedback from team memebers on what should be flow for the fucntionality for each sub domain and what front end components needs to be placed where . This feedback helped each team member to get an over all idea of how their sub domain would interact with the user.

One member from our team designed the wireframe diagram based on the frontend components and flow decided by the team. This wireframe was analysed by the team and because of this process of the feedback we where able to figure out the parts that he has missed with the wireframe. After this he updated the wireframe accordingly.

## Week 4:

**4. Communication -- neville**

This week was the midterm week and hence correct communication about project work was of utmost importance. It was decided that project related deliverables would be reviewed in the next week and there will be no face to face meeting during the week.

Our discussions continued on our **slack channel** where we discussed about the user activity logging functionality. Keeping the project timeline in mind it was decided to start uploading code for the respective modules onto our repository so that a peer review can be initiated.

Looking forward to the next week where we will be starting off with the complete application architecture design and building, deploying pieces that are ready.
